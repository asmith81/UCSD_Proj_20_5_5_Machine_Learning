This project is submitted for completion of the requirement Mini-Project: More Experience With Machine Learning Models
in section 20.5.5 of the UCSD Certificate course in AI/ML Engineering.  

I started this project in a colab notebook but ran into processing problems running it on the google hardware.  
To overcome these challenges I switched to a SageMaker environment in AWS.  The processing went much better in that runtime environment. 

I have copied that jupyter notebook and the associated data file into this repo.  I hope it can be run by the grader in whatever runtime environment they may use.
